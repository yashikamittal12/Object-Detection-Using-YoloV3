Project Description
Title: Object Detection and Counting Using YOLOv3

Overview:
This project aims to develop a robust system capable of detecting and counting objects in images using the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) object detection model. The project leverages the computational resources available in Google Colab to perform real-time object detection with high accuracy. The ultimate goal is to create a reusable function that inputs an image and outputs the number of detected objects, along with a processed image showing the detected objects.

Objective:
The primary objective is to implement a deep learning-based object detection system using the YOLOv3 model. The system should be able to accurately identify various objects within an image, count the number of detected objects, and display the results in a user-friendly manner.

Methodology
Environment Setup:
The first step involves setting up the environment by installing the necessary libraries, including OpenCV for image processing and NumPy for numerical operations. These libraries are essential for handling and manipulating the image data efficiently.

Downloading YOLOv3 Model Files:
To utilize the YOLOv3 model, it is necessary to download the pre-trained weights, configuration files, and COCO class names. The pre-trained weights provide the trained model parameters, the configuration files define the model architecture, and the class names list the objects that the model can detect.

Loading the YOLOv3 Model:
Once the required files are downloaded, the next step is to load the YOLOv3 model using OpenCV's DNN module. This involves reading the configuration and weights files to initialize the model. The COCO class names are also loaded to interpret the detected objects.

Image Preparation and Processing:
The image provided by the user is read and converted into a format suitable for YOLOv3 processing. This involves resizing the image and normalizing the pixel values. The processed image is then passed through the YOLOv3 model to perform object detection.

Object Detection and Bounding Box Extraction:
The YOLOv3 model processes the image and outputs the bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class IDs for the detected objects. A threshold is applied to the confidence scores to filter out low-confidence detections. Non-max suppression is used to eliminate redundant bounding boxes for the same object.

Counting Detected Objects:
The filtered bounding boxes are used to count the number of detected objects. Each bounding box corresponds to a detected object, and the count of these bounding boxes gives the total number of detected objects in the image.

Displaying and Saving Results:
The final step involves drawing the bounding boxes and class labels on the original image to visually represent the detected objects. The processed image is saved, and the total count of detected objects is printed or returned as the output.
